# NewsVista
A news app implementation based on Material 3 Fortnightly

This is the repository of the app NewsVista. It is based on the design for the Fortnightly app in Google Material Design website, but using Material 3 instead of Material 2 and Jetpack Compose instead of View architecture: https://m2.material.io/design/material-studies/fortnightly.html

The app itself is a simple news presentation app, retrieving news from the New York Times API, and presenting the most relevant current news in a visually pleasant manner to the user. The app is also meant to showcase my skills modern software engineering techniques, tools and procedures. This app was made in Kotlin for Android, using Jetpack Compose and Coil for now, but I am planning to use other features like coroutines, Retrofit2, multi-layout responsivity, the MVVM architecture, Room database, Work Manager, Unit and Instrumentation tests.

For the visual fidelity to Fortnightly, I'm using Adi Chakravarty Figma layout: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1125542410508509052

To adapt the Material 2 format into Material 3, I'm using the official migration guide from Android Developers: https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/material2-material3
